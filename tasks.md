# Tasks

This file tracks project tasks, completed work, and future work needed.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] AGENTS.md System Design Document Creation
  - Design focused on local development environment
  - Event-driven architecture definition
  - Project structure definition
  - Technology stack selection (local version)

- [x] React Vite app bootstrap
  - Scaffolded `frontend/` via `npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts` to satisfy the interview prerequisite
  - Installed dependencies and documented `npm install` / `npm run dev` workflow so setup is reproducible
  - Ran `npm run build` to ensure the starter compiles before the interview begins

- [x] Dev run helper script
  - Added `run-dev.sh` at the repo root to `cd` into `frontend`, ensure dependencies exist, and run the Vite dev server
  - Implemented single automatic restart after the first `Ctrl+C` so accidental interrupts do not require manual restarts
  - Documented usage in the new root `README.md` so interview prep instructions live alongside the script

- [x] CHANGELOG English alignment
  - Reworded all entries for versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 in English per the updated expectation
  - Confirmed future changelog updates will follow the same language standard
